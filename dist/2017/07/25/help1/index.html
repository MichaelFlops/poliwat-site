<h4 id="i-dream-in-poliwat">I dream in POLIWAT</h4>

<p>First off some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/github">sound</a></p>

<h6 id="i-have-been-completely-sober-for-5-days">I have been completely sober for 5 days</h6>

<p><em>Tuesday 952 PM</em></p>

<p>At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I&rsquo;ll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight.
My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks. Jack is coming from San Mateo to Santa Cruz tomorrow to work on the Sims Sims with me so I&rsquo;ll ask him to pick one up for me.</p>

<p>Stefan my roommate already said I could use his laptop for work tomorrow, so with my last battery I&rsquo;ll push this live and hopefully install git if I have enough time. But I won&rsquo;t have enough time. I&rsquo;m working a lot at my job doing web development. I am a terrible programmer, and I have no business doing it. I&rsquo;m trying to switch careers, so every hour after work I attempt to do something towards that. I&rsquo;m starting a digital media company in the next month, and I want to make a living as an artist. Specifically in audio and video.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming back from a long weekend in my hometown, San Luis Obispo (SLO). I came down to film my pregnant sister for a music video. Stefan and I spent the last week working on the instrumental together, and we&rsquo;ve been writing and recording vocals on it. The instrumental has taken a nice shape, but the words/flow need help and also the video needs some more editing. One of my best childhood friends and essentially little brother <a href="http://chadlamon.com">Chad</a> helped film and he did a great job throwing a quick cut together.</p>

<p>In 7 days I&rsquo;m going to Michigan for the first time in my life with my dad, for the most epic bonding experience ever. I say that because he grew up there, and I will meet a lot of family I&rsquo;ve heard little about, for the first time. I hope my <a href="http://snapchat.com">snapchat</a> glasses come in the mail first so I can document the trip well and in a low-profile way. I will for sure collect audio and post here.</p>

<p>This is my first online journal entry. I&rsquo;m not a strong writer. But I have been journalling extensively since 2011, primarily in <a href="http://evernote.com">evernote</a>. My journals as of late have become much more schizo and unreadable lately. So my thought is that if I publish them online then they&rsquo;ll be a little more cohesive. Also it&rsquo;s an exercise in the practice of vulnerability. If you are vulnerable with your friends and enemies, then you can really go far.</p>

<p>Listening to Kendrick on the Bus. I printed out a couple of his songs that I&rsquo;m working on memorizing. That&rsquo;s because when my girlfriend of two years left me, I made a bucket list. The things I need to do before I die. And for some reason I wrote know every kendrick line. It&rsquo;s been a couple months and I&rsquo;ve still been working on it. I also did acid and walked / ran to the beach overnight, to take a dip in the ocean as a cleanse from her. Although I don&rsquo;t want to see her ever again, I do still feel self conscious at the thought of her seeing what I do on the internet. After the breakup I made a series of audio journals where I went mad hatter - you can listen to the chaos <a href="soundcloud.com/poliwat">here</a>. They are private audio tracks, you can only access them through this link. Please don&rsquo;t share. Or do. Who am I talking to, this is my journal? Future Michael.</p>

<p>There was a man on the train today that got real drunk and attacked an employee. The police came and I watched the guy down a beer in front of the police before they arrested him. Check your posture, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/github/post-office-1-grasshopper-my-grasshopper-v1">grasshopper</a>.</p>

<p>Everyday is a battle. I fight to successfully execute at least 1% of my ideas. I&rsquo;m fucked. Quitting drugs  doesn&rsquo;t cure the natural-born junkie mindset. My mom&rsquo;s an alcoholic and my dad is hyped on enough pain killers each day it could kill a horse. Well a hobbits horse, so more like a mule or pony. My new drug of choice is adrenaline, and I have a multifaceted strategy for achieving a healthy dose each day. While on my bike (that my boss recently lent me) I like to disregard every traffic rule with headphones on, going to my destination as fast as I possibly can.</p>

<p>My daily commute includes about 23+ junkies, transients, addicts, or homeless humans. I like to bike by and shout IM ON CRACK and act all crazy towards them, when I&rsquo;m dead sober. That&rsquo;s been the latest adrenaline fix. There are seasons to it.</p>

<p>This blog is going to have audio, as I am a composer. One of my professors at <a href="ucsc.edu">uni</a> drove me home last week, and it put me in a good mood for 3 days. I consider <a href="http://davidkant.com">david kant</a> a mentor.
One of these next posts will be a fun one all about my mentors. If you treat everyone like a mentor, and really <em>listen</em>, you can <a href="google.com/picasso">steal</a> the best parts about them. That&rsquo;s what I am primarily. A consesus of all the humans I&rsquo;ve interacted with. I&rsquo;ve talked extensively to just about every type of human you can imagine, and there is serious value to be derived from all of them. God damn the <a href="sanjose17.com">17</a> is fucking insane. I&rsquo;m wearing flip flops and a button up.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s hawt on the temple, another post is going to be about&hellip; no fuck this I will make a list of some nugs from evernote that have never seen the light of day.</p>
