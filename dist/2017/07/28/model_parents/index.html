<p>I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</p>

<p>Growing up I always wished my parents were more affluent, challenging, and driven. It wasn&rsquo;t until the time I left for college that I became truly okay with my upbringing. It&rsquo;s incredible what a 4 hour drive distance will do to your relationships. I&rsquo;ll include a photo of my parents when I get to their house sometime tomorrow afternoon. This is my journal, and I just needed to have a separate entry for something that is quite a real aspect of my life. I don&rsquo;t believe I can ever be a good programmer. I didn&rsquo;t do well in math classes as a kid, and even in college got a &rsquo;D&rsquo; in Calculus. Twice.</p>

<p>What I did learn however is the feeling of unrequitted, unconditional love. My parents have always allowed me to explore the world, and I went from die hard extreme Rush Limbaugh disciple Right wing twat to dumb barefoot hippy liberal all on my own accord. They have shown love to me in times that I was objectively unlovable, and I can feel the power from their efforts every single day.</p>

<p>In a couple days I will be in my father&rsquo;s</p>

<p>Speaking of love. There is no feeling on the planet like that of a good woman missed. ^&amp;#$%^ broke up with me. She never seemed to experience this unconditional love I feel from my parents. From my view she gave up on my offer of it. However is it unconditional if it expires? She&rsquo;s an intern at <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> now, making double the money doing what she loves. I got her into programming in the first place, and she sky rocketed ahead. However it came at a cost of interpersonal relationships. She&rsquo;s sort of a creep. Is it unconditional love? At this point in time I can&rsquo;t see her as much more than a parasite with a <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> ass.</p>
