Sunday 108 PM

I'm pissed
#### real pissed.

all I've got done today is 25 pushups / 50 confucious canooes / took my laptop apart.
heading to the store for the second time with my dad to get a bunch of tiny star screwdrivers. I'm just going to get a kit of 1-10mm for this time and in the future.

Of the two meetings I scheduled with friends today, both forgot, and I should've completely been expecting that.
Google calendar doesn't mean anything with friends.

But I did get some zelda in this morning, and killed a Lynel while balancing on a big exercise ball. I didn't eat the best today so far so I need to up my game. I got git init 6pack!

Made a quick video of some ab exercises and sent to Jack - he's helping name them. Then I'm going to produce music and a workout circuit that's spirituality and the 12-step program based. I'll make a draft of the whole idea and then pitch it to this other Michael Betts who is a fitness trainer!

I'm going to ask for him to be my 'ab sponsor' and we produce a workout video together
AA - abs anayonmous

I have gogole alerts setup so that for any Michael Betts that pops up in the news I get an email. Lately this Michael Betts that's a personal trainer has been featured in articles and has a bunch of twitter followers. It would be amazing to produce a video with him.

I gave Jack full control of [wespr](https://wespr.org) a couple days ago and helped him redesign the site a bit, it's looking sweet! Going to officially start an LLC when I get back from Michigan.

I'm less angry now that I worked out a bit. There's always a healthy way to manage emotions, and it's fun to use them to your advantage. Going to practice some Kendrick now.
