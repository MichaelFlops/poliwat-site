#### this project is special
  
I started she breaking glass ceiling last Fall. I made the hook of the track while walking from my dorm to the studio listening to a BADBADNOTGOOD track on repeat. I got the flow of it and wanted to fix the words, it took hours to get it to its final form here;

```
You'll need a lighter to hire her
she aspire to conquer
perspire till you retire
she think in code on computer
she walking you stalker
she feeling you heeling
at uni barely breaking even
but breaking glass Ceiling

she breaking glass ceiling

```
