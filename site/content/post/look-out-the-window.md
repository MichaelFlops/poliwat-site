##### Amtrak was two hours late.

I wrote lyrics and planned for [github.center](/posts/github.center.md) . I'm *almost* okay with sharing a secret, but not yet. Maybe in a future post.

The name of the game on this train ride, lets see here ...

```
organize sound library
```
```
learn about teensy ++ arduino
```
```
destroy calamity ganon
```

Listening to A$AP Rocky, but not a huge fan. There's smarter stuff out there.
